## What is Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)?

Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy where an investor divides the total amount to be invested across periodic purchases of a target asset. Instead of making a single, lump-sum investment, you invest a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of the assetâ€™s price at the time. This approach is particularly beneficial in volatile markets or for long-term investments.

1. **Reduce Risks** 
2. **Avoids Market Timing**
3. **Takes Advantage of Market Volatility**

By using this Python model, you can analyze the performance of DCA for any stock, adjust the investment interval, and even compare it to alternative strategies. This allows you to make informed decisions based on data and remove the emotional element from investing.
